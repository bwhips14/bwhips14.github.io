			  <h1>Encage</h1>
			  <h2>printed book</h2>
<p>'Encage' tells the story of twentieth-century experimental music composer John Cage. A renegade of the classical music world, Cage took apart the rules of music composition, specifically those of his mentor Arnold Schoenberg, to create his own brand of sound experience.</p>

<p>Through a series of ripped pages juxtaposed next to those left in tact, 'Encage' presents both theorists' ideas one after the other in a form a action reaction dialogue. The stark, bold typography of the John Cage pages contrasts the classical page structure of those belonging to Schoenberg. Each ripped page was hand-dyed in a combination of tea and other substances to achieve an old-fashioned look and touch. The final page of the book is a pull-out, marking John Cage as the godfather of punk rock, a genre dedicated to musicians who have gone against traditions to create something new.</p>
