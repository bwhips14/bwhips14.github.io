		  <h1>What I do</h1>
		  <h2>branding, web, print, illustration, photography</h2>
		  <p>
Hey! My name's Brendan and I'm a graphic designer from Boston, Massachusetts. While most new designers tend to design for designers, I make a conscious effot to design only for the client. There is no single trend that can solve every design problem. I treat each project as independent from one another, and it gives me a very unique and diverse skillest. Rather than focusing on my own personal style, I always think about what is the best way to solve whatever problem I am faced with.</p>
		  <p>
I am fluent in the Adobe Creative Suite as well as HTML/CSS/JS. My work mixes my knowledge of and experience with photography and illustration, both analog and digital, with extensive knowledge of modern and classic typography. Although it represents a small amount of my body of work, I also have extensive knowledge of storyboarding and framing for videos and animations.</p>

		  <h1>Who I am</h1>
		  <h2>musician, researcher, problem solver, human</h2>
		  <p>
As far as my personal life goes, my hobbies include playing piano and guitar, as well as pick-up soccer. My interests include sports, US history, economics, architecture, and jazz piano, all of which influence myself as a person and a designer. I am always open to learning new techniques and practices to grow as a designer.</p>
